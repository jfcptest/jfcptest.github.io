        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the next article, I will develop the concept for a VR musical experience inspired by techno music and created for a web environment using WebXR, three.js and the Web Audio API. This project will be unfolding throughout the class of Studio 2, that takes place in the Master of Animation, Games and Interactivity; at RMIT University, during 2021-1.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container content">
        <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <p>The techno scene has played a fundamental role during a big part of my life. For many years, especially during my adolescence and entering adulthood, my personal conception of nightlife and parties were merely translated as a social interactive ritual, and more specifically, a romantic one; where you attended to find a couple or a simple casual meeting.</p>
        <p>I was dragged by one of my best friends to my first techno party, previously discussing my interest with him without even experiencing that specific style of music, while considering myself a big fan of electronic music, which is a very broad term to vaguely describe a group of music genres produced by different analog and digital tools: synths, keyboards, drum machines, production software, among others.</p>
    </div>

        <span class="image-description">Sonido Central, the first club I ever attended in Cali, Colombia.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="container content">
        <p>Just after I entered the place, I was immediately captivated by its unique young vibe, thanks to the combination of different factors like the use of experimental/different/alternative sounds, physical expression without any rules, the presence of visual effects generated by laser, light projections, among others. All of these elements work in conjunction to generate a captivating experience for younger audiences; although techno is not a recent creation, it still can be stated that it is not widely accepted by most of mature audiences, maybe because of its disruptive musical nature, examination of structured and non-structured rhythms, and possibly the introduction of new systems and technologies that distance themselves from the ones used in the past.</p>
        <p>For Alistair Riddell, in his essay <span class="span-italic">Ecstasy Solfège</span>, where he talks about music technology and techno music, experimentation with new technologies are often relegated to the younger generations:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container content">
        <p class="p-italic">“From the 1960s onwards, music technology has been essential to youth cultural development and participation in technological evolution is frequently and conveniently the domain of the young. Consider how many 60 year olds there might be hacking code with unbridled enthusiasm for 30 hours straight. More likely, by the time anyone reaches that age, they can employ 20 year olds to do that. So with technology, you get a window of opportunity, that tends to close when you are not spending 60-75% of your day actively engaged in it. And as a consequence, young people, left to their own devices, often come up with interesting and relevant projects.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container content">
        <p>With this in mind, Riddell also suggests “Also by their very nature, youth activities can draw upon an endless stream of young people”. At that time, my younger self was trying to take distance from the context I was used to be in: the salsa culture and latin dances that are still abundant and predominant in my city. Historically, their existence and contributions to the culture and invaluable, and must be preserved by any means; but during my entire life, these genres were not a place for innovation for my ears. Instead, techno scene presented a lot of different opportunities but the biggest one of them was the ability to be experienced as one-person event, just closing my eyes and listening to the different sounds that were new for me at that time, I felt the urge to move however I wanted, without an specific set of dance moves, the freedom that I felt was really powerful. Then, when you open your eyes, you’re greeted by this visuals that makes you feel out of this world.</p>

        <p>Because of this, I think VR is a great opportunity to create a similar experience. In a world that is more isolated than ever, thanks to technology and the current pandemic context; virtual experiences are seeing an exponential rise. Its appeal may come in different ways, but with all the challenges that are being presented with social isolation (mental health issues, loneliness, etc) I would like to highlight its potential to create a sensory and powerful experience, being able to provide the user with a self-reflective and healing experience.</p>
        <p>One of my objectives with this project is, without seeking to demonstrate in a psychological/scientific way, the possibility of creating a powerful experience with techno music that is both visually and audibly pleasant; aiming for the reduction of negative feelings/sentiments and being able to introduce the user to something similar to what I was presented when I had the opportunity to live my first techno experience.</p>

        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>WebVR, focused solely on VR, dates from 2014 when it was conceived, but version 1.0 was not released until 2016. However, it was quickly discontinued in 2018 when WebXR came to replace it, as it included support for both VR and AR.</p>
        <p>The first test and experimental projects were created, initially with WebVR, by the same development teams to promote the tool. With the discontinuation of this API, many of the projects were not updated. However, we can still see some records, such as this Google page dedicated to showing its developments with the tool:</p>

        <p>One of the projects that most caught my attention, and which apparently is the only one accessible to date (03/22/2021) within Google's musical portfolio, is called Dance Tonite, which is an experience carried out in collaboration with the artist LCD Soundsystem, and consists of the creation of a small 3D music video where motion capture was used, using only VR equipment, to record the dances and movements of the different characters that are part of the clip. In it, we can visualize the experience from various points of view, both from the camera that travels the stage and from the characters who are performing their choreographies.</p>

        <p>A short but quite effective project is Resonate: Audio Reactive, where we can explore a space with a series of geometric figures that react to the rhythm of a song. From their movements to their color, the lines and waves are constantly changing to reflect musical sounds and patterns.</p>

        <p>We see that the Mozilla team also decided to experiment with motion capture and developed a small VR experience where the user can use their VR equipment to record a short dance and share it with their friends or other users.</p>

        <p>In this experiment called Monster or Friend, we find a space inhabited by a procedurally animated creature, which, accompanied by music, provides us with a mysterious experience where we ask ourselves: what is that creature and where is it headed?</p>

        <p>These are just a few short examples demonstrating what WebXR is capable of. At the moment, there is rather little that we can find and clearly represents a great void, but also a huge opportunity to continue exploring what this API offers. In my opinion, I think that more VR applications should direct their development to the web for different reasons: the first is its easy access since it is only necessary to use a web browser, the second is the multi-device support that allows you to play the applications from desktops to phones, the third reason is the rapid evolution of the web ecosystem that in a short time will be able to offer more and more complex experiences.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container content">
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>First of all, I will be developing this Studio 2 project for a web environment, being able to be run on most of modern web browsers, from desktops to mobile phones. With this, let me do a quick listing of the tools/frameworks I will use to achieve this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span-bold">three.js:</span> is a JavaScript 3D library creating for the sole purpose of making 3D development easier and accessible for broader audience.</li>
            <li><span class="span-bold">WebXR:</span> WebXR is the current API to provide VR/AR capabilities to a web page/application.</li>
            <li"><span class="span-bold">Web Audio API:</span> Web Audio API is the standard system for controlling audio on the web.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Regarding the idea, first I will explain what is the direction I am aiming at and then I will break down the project into its different parts such as sound, atmosphere and interaction. Basically the idea of the project is to develop a VR music room strongly inspired by techno music, where the user can experience a visual journey accompanied by a piece of music specifically made for it.</p>
        <p>The user will find itself in the center of a small extraterrestrial planet, where the elements/objects, inspired by the current games of lights and futuristic sets present in the most famous clubs and festivals around the world, will react to the rhythm and sounds of the music piece, both in real time (elements that interactively react to sound frequencies) and scripted events/effects.</p>
        <p>Why both? The fact that there are previously scripted elements allows the experience to be directed in a more organized way, triggering events throughout the project that convey different sensations and emotions. By creating certain interactive elements that react in real time, they will contribute as visual projections that will enhance the experience.</p>
        <p>As you can see in the following moodboard, I am looking for a geometric and neon look, inspired by futuristic settings and bright colors that stand out with the dark colors of the backgrounds.</p>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div class="container content">
        <p>The different elements will make use of different styles of animations such as activation/deactivation, radiations, rotations.</p>
        <p>The sound and musicalization is the fundamental piece of the project. The idea is to collaborate with a student from Audiovision or a producer who can develop a personalized piece of music solely for this experience. The fact that it will be tailored specifically for the project will allow us to section the different tracks and sounds that make up the song to be able to apply effects more easily.</p>
        <p>With this in mind, the base of the interactive component for the sound visualization will be the fundamental principle of EQing. Basically, “an equalizer is simply a tool that lets you adjust the volume of the individual frequencies within an audio source”. The simplest division of frequencies are lows, mids and highs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <span class="span-bold">lows</span> contain sounds that are perceived by humans as soft.</li>
            <li>The <span class="span-bold">mids</span> contain most of the melodies and vocal elements.</li>
            <li>The <span class="span-bold">highs</span> contain the hi hats, snares, melodies with high frequencies and certain vocal parts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For this reason, I decided that by dividing the sound into these three frequency channels, it would be correct to represent them in different parts of the planet: the lows would be represented with visuals on the ground, the mids could work with floating elements and objects that rest on the ground, and the highs would work with visuals and effects in the sky.</p>

        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <p>At the end of the semester, I hope to develop a virtual reality music room, running within a web application that can be accessed from most current devices.</p>
